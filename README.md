This is a repository that follows my progression from knowing nothing about electronics to making  a flight controller for model rockets. The purpose of said controller is to stabilize the rocket using thrust vector control  and to eject the parachute at the correct time. Meanwhile, it will collect data useful for improving the project flight by flight.  

Note : The repository was created some months after I started my effort, at a point when I had built an altitude tracker and some rough CAD models of the thrust vectoring mount.
