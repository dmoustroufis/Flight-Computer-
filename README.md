# Flight-Computer-
This is a repository that follows my progression from knowing nothing about electronics to making  a flight computer for model rockets. The purpose of said computer is to stabilize the rocket using thrust vector control (utilizing a PID controller) and to eject the parachute at the correct time. Meanwhile, it will collect data useful for improving the system flight by flight.  

Note : The repository was created some months after I started my effort, at a point when I had built an altitude tracker and some rough CAD models of the thrust vectoring mount.
